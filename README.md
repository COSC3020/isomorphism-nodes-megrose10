# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they
cannot be isomorphic. I have started with the formal definition of isomorphism
below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

If two graphs do not have the same number of nodes, a one-to-one mapping is not possible.
If you have a G1 with 3 nodes, and G2 with 2 nodes, you cannot map each vertex in G2 to G1, which 
does not follow the above defintion. If mapping is not possible, they do not have the same structure,
leading to two non-isomorphic graphs.
